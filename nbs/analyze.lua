-- nbs/analyze.lua
--
-- PURE load-time analysis pass for a decoded Note Block Studio song.
--
-- FROZEN PUBLIC INTERFACE
--   local analyze = require("nbs.analyze")
--   analyze.analyze(song) -> result
--
--   `song` is the value produced by nbs.decode (fields used here: header,
--   notes); `result` has these EXACT field names:
--     total_notes              integer  #song.notes
--     ticks_per_second         number   header.tempo_ticks_per_second
--     tick_ms                  number   1000 / ticks_per_second
--     peak_concurrent          integer  number of notes in the reported window
--     peak_window_ms           integer  50 (constant)
--     vanilla_notes_at_peak    integer  reported-window notes classified "vanilla"
--     play_sound_notes_at_peak integer  reported-window notes classified "play_sound"
--     custom_notes_at_peak     integer  reported-window notes classified "custom"
--     has_extended_range       boolean  true when ANY key is outside 33..57
--     min_key, max_key         integer  over all notes (0 and 0 when there are none)
--     all_notes_custom         boolean  true when the song has notes but NONE of
--                                        them classify as vanilla/play_sound --
--                                        i.e. every note is refused at playback
--     loop = { loop, max_loop_count, loop_start_tick }  copied from the header
--
--   THE REPORTED WINDOW is the 50 ms window that maximises the number of
--   CAPACITY-CONSUMING notes (vanilla + play_sound); ties go to the EARLIEST
--   window.  Custom notes are refused at playback, so they do NOT steer the
--   selection -- a crowd of them must never hide a real vanilla/trumpet burst
--   elsewhere and understate the requirement.  `custom_notes_at_peak` exposes
--   the refused notes that happen to share the reported window, so
--     vanilla_notes_at_peak + play_sound_notes_at_peak + custom_notes_at_peak
--       == peak_concurrent
--   and vanilla_notes_at_peak + play_sound_notes_at_peak is the maximum
--   capacity-consuming count over every 50 ms window in the song.
--
--   A song with NO capacity-consuming note has no requirement to maximise, so
--   the reported window falls back to the all-notes maximum burst; both buckets
--   and the requirement stay 0 while peak_concurrent still describes the
--   song's density.
--
-- This module is a PURE function: it reads no clock, touches no peripheral, does
-- no file I/O and relies on no global mutable state, so calling it twice on the
-- same song yields byte-identical values.  It only READS `song`; it never mutates
-- its input.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- THE INVARIANT MOST LIKELY TO BE DONE WRONG: NBS TICK != 50 ms GAME TICK
-- ===========================================================================
-- NBS stores tempo as `tempo_raw` in hundredths of a "tick per second", so
--
--     ticks_per_second = tempo_raw / 100
--     ONE NBS TICK     = 1000 / ticks_per_second  milliseconds
--
-- The Minecraft speaker ceiling (one note per instrument per game tick) is
-- enforced per GAME tick, and one game tick is 50 ms -- a DIFFERENT clock from
-- the NBS tick.  Conflating the two is the single most likely bug here.
--
-- Worked example: at 10 NBS ticks/second, `tick_ms` is 100, so every NBS tick
-- spans TWO 50 ms game windows.  Ten notes on one NBS tick share one instant
-- (one window, peak 10), while ten notes on ten CONSECUTIVE NBS ticks are 100 ms
-- apart (ten separate windows, peak 1).  The window test is on millisecond time,
-- never on tick distance.
--
-- PEAK ALGORITHM
--   1. Map each note to a start time in ms: t = note.tick * tick_ms, and
--      classify it ONCE with instrument_table.bucket_of.
--   2. Sort those times ascending.
--   3. Two-pointer sliding window: for each left index i, advance a right index
--      j while times[j] - times[i] < 50 (STRICT `<`, so a gap of exactly 50 ms
--      starts a new window).
--   4. The REPORTED window is the one maximising the count of capacity-
--      CONSUMING notes (vanilla + play_sound) inside it -- NOT the total count.
--      Custom notes consume nothing and are refused at playback, so letting
--      them win the selection is exactly the bug that reported required == 0
--      while a vanilla burst elsewhere would drop.  A prefix sum of the
--      capacity flags makes each window's capacity count O(1).  Anchoring the
--      left edge on a note is complete: the maximum over all 50 ms windows is
--      attained by a window whose left edge sits on some note, and sliding an
--      optimal window's left edge right to its first capacity-consuming note
--      keeps every such note inside.
--   5. peak_concurrent is the number of ALL notes in the reported window
--      (customs included) -- that is the field's frozen meaning.  When the song
--      has no capacity-consuming note at all, step 4 has no maximum to find,
--      so the fallback is the all-notes maximum burst; the buckets and the
--      requirement stay 0.
--
-- INSTRUMENT BUCKETS (only the reported window is classified)
--   The classification rule has ONE owner: nbs/instrument_table.bucket_of --
--   the same classifier player/plan.lua reaches through resolve().  A
--   re-implementation here (hardcoded 0..15 / 16..19 constants) previously
--   DISAGREED with resolve for vanilla counts 10 and 17..19, which
--   under-budgeted speakers for v6 trumpets and produced a bogus "speakers"
--   warning for legacy custom ids.  Delegating keeps the analyzer's budget
--   identical to the calls the player will actually make:
--     vanilla     below the file's vanilla boundary, id 0..15
--     play_sound  16..19 below that boundary (the v6 "trumpet" native sounds)
--     custom      anything else -- refused at playback, so it counts toward
--                 NEITHER bucket AND does not steer the peak selection; it is
--                 reported separately as custom_notes_at_peak when it shares
--                 the window the requirement was computed from.
--
-- TIE-BREAK (deterministic)
--   When several distinct windows attain the same maximum CAPACITY count, the
--   reported split is taken from the EARLIEST window in time (the smallest left
--   index).  The selection loop only replaces the recorded peak on a STRICT
--   increase, so the first window to reach the maximum wins.
--
-- Lua 5.2 / Cobalt constraints honoured: no `//`, no bitwise operators, no
-- utf8.*, no math.maxinteger, no collectgarbage, no string.dump, no os.exit.
