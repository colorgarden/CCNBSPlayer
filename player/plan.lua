-- player/plan.lua
--
-- The PURE event planner: turns a decoded NBS song into a FULLY-ORDERED list of
-- timed speaker events.  This module is the DETERMINISM ANCHOR of the player.
--
-- FROZEN PUBLIC INTERFACE
--   local plan = require("player.plan")
--   plan.plan(song, analysis) -> <array of events>
--
--   song      the value produced by nbs.decode (fields used here: header,
--             layers, notes).  NEVER mutated.
--   analysis  the value produced by nbs.analyze (field used here: tick_ms).
--
--   Each event table uses EXACTLY these keys:
--     t_ms          number   = tick_index * analysis.tick_ms
--     tick_index    integer  the note's tick
--     layer_index   integer  the note's layer (0-based)
--     note_index    integer  1-based index WITHIN its (tick, layer) group
--     instrument    integer  the raw NBS instrument id
--     key           integer
--     kind          "play_note" | "play_sound" | "custom"  (instrument_table)
--     name          string, or nil exactly when kind == "custom"
--     custom_index  integer, or nil unless kind == "custom"
--     volume        number, 0..3   (mapping.speaker_volume of combined volume)
--     pitch         integer, semitones, UNCLAMPED (mapping.pitch_semitones)
--     pitch_cents   number, the cents residual (mapping.cents_to_semitones)
--     layer_volume  integer, the source layer's volume (default 100 if missing)
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- THE FROZEN TOTAL ORDER -- THE MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT
-- ===========================================================================
-- Events are sorted ASCENDING by the tuple
--
--     (tick_index, layer_index, note_index)
--
-- note_index is the THIRD and final key.  It is NOT a globally unique id: it is
-- a 1-based position WITHIN each (tick_index, layer_index) group (see below), so
-- it is exactly the field through which the caller's input array order reaches
-- the output.  Two notes in the SAME (tick, layer) group are ordered by the
-- order they appear in `song.notes`; the planner does NOT re-order within a
-- group.  For two notes in DIFFERENT groups the input order is irrelevant.
-- The sort is performed with an EXPLICIT comparison function (see less_event):
-- do NOT "optimise" it away on the assumption that the input is pre-sorted, and
-- do NOT sort by t_ms alone (t_ms is a function of tick_index, so it adds no
-- information and would drop the layer/note tiebreak).
--
-- *** WARNING TO FUTURE EDITORS ***
-- The Tier-2 integration tests assert on the ORDERED sequence of speaker calls
-- the plan produces.  That comparison is only meaningful because this module
-- fixes the order deterministically.  Introducing any dependence on a hash-table
-- iteration order (`pairs`) or on the clock would make those integration
-- assertions flaky.  The input array's order is DELIBERATELY significant for
-- note_index WITHIN a (tick, layer) group, but it must be read from the array
-- POSITIONS -- never from an unordered table walk.  This module must stay a
-- pure, total, deterministic function: no clock, no peripherals, no I/O, no
-- globals, no mutation of its inputs.  Calling plan(song, analysis) twice on the
-- SAME input array must give byte-identical output.
--
-- HOW note_index IS COMPUTED
--   A note_index belongs to a (tick, layer) GROUP and restarts at 1 for each new
--   group.  This module builds an orderable list of the input notes keyed by
--   (tick, layer, position-in-input), sorts THAT list once, and then walks it in
--   order, incrementing a counter while consecutive entries share the same
--   (tick, layer) and resetting it to 1 otherwise.  The input position is the
--   tiebreak for notes already in the same (tick, layer) group, and because that
--   position becomes note_index -- the third sort key -- it DOES determine the
--   emitted order of same-group notes.  The planner never re-orders inside a
--   group; a caller that wants a specific within-group order must supply it in
--   `song.notes`.
--
-- t_ms IS DERIVED, NEVER ACCUMULATED
--   t_ms = tick_index * analysis.tick_ms is computed per event from the note's
--   own tick.  It is deliberately NOT advanced with `previous_t_ms + tick_ms`:
--   progressive addition would accumulate floating-point rounding error and
--   break the drift guarantee a later module relies on.  With a repeating
--   tick_ms (e.g. 1000/3) tick N still reports exactly N * tick_ms.
--
-- CUSTOM NOTES ARE STILL EMITTED
--   This module does not decide whether a note is PLAYED; it PLANS.  A custom
--   instrument becomes an event with kind == "custom", name == nil and a
--   custom_index.  The dispatch layer refuses it later.  Emitting it keeps the
--   plan a faithful, complete projection of the song, which is exactly what
--   makes a plan-vs-recording comparison meaningful.
--
-- MISSING LAYER
--   The decoded layer array is 1-based, so layer_index L reads layers[L + 1].
--   A note referencing a layer beyond the decoded list (or a song with no
--   layers at all) is NOT dropped and does NOT raise: the layer volume defaults
--   to 100, the substitution is recorded in the event's own layer_volume field,
--   and the event is still emitted in its correct place in the order.
--
-- VOLUME
--   mapping.combined_volume(layer_volume, note.velocity) first (the NBS
--   combination formula), then mapping.speaker_volume(combined) (the 0..3
--   speaker scaling), in that order.
--
-- Lua 5.2 / Cobalt constraints honoured: no `//`, no bitwise operators, no
-- utf8.*, no math.maxinteger, no collectgarbage, no string.dump, no os.exit.
-- `pairs` is never used over a hash table anywhere in this module.
